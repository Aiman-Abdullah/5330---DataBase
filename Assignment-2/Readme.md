# Objective: 
design and implement a database for keeping track of.
Covid-19 vaccination program that is currently undergoing at federal, state.
and local level in USA.

# The database should be designed to show number of
shots procured by federal government and distributed to all states. States, in
turn distribute the same to various local bodies such as
- health care centers such as hospitals or long-term care facilities,
- city run covid vaccination camps
- private labs and pharmacy outlets such as Walgreens, CVS, Walmart
etc.
The system also should be capable of showing what types of vaccines has
been procured from which manufacturers and distributed to which unit
(state/local etc.).
The system should be designed to keeps track of following regarding
progress -
- Manufacturers
- Number of doses procured by manufacturer, by types
- Number of doses distributed by unit (state/local/independent) by
manufacturer, by types
- Date-wise doses administered by unit (state/local/independent)
- Doses administered should be identifiable if it is the first dose or
second dose for the individual
- People who are getting administered, their name, address, contact,
age, medical conditions, any kinds of allergy, vaccination phase they
fall
- How many doses shipped by federal body (CDC)
- How many distributed
The system should be capable of generating reports about the vaccination
progress –
- Daily progress per million population
- Cumulative progress
You can assume the following for –
Vaccination phases for population groups/phases
- 1A (Healthcare – Tier1)
- 1A – Healthcase (Tier2)
- 1A – long tern care – assisted living residents
- 1A – long-term care – nursing home residents
- 1B – 16-64 any medical condition
- 1B – population over 65
- 1C - Education and child care personnel
- 2 – people 16 years and older
The vaccine types can be-
- Whole virus - Covaxin
- Protein subunit - Novavax
- Viral vector – Johnson and Johnson, CanSino, AstraZeneca
- Nucleic acid or mRNA based – Pfizer-BioNTech & Moderna


# achievement:
1- design ER/EER schema diagram based upon the COVIDVACCINE
2- map the ER/EER schema design
to a relational database schema, and create the tables corresponding to the
relational schema using the ORACLE DBMS 
3- load some data into the database and apply
certain update transactions and retrieval queries
4- Write Trigger
# Tools:
1- MySQL
2- Python ( To load / Update Records)
