Explanations:

1- Patient Table, PId is the foreign key and it takes this information from 
the PatientsPersonalInfo table and the relationship
 is many-to-one, it includes other columns like Vaccination phase,
 LocalBodyID which is a Foreign key and it includes the ID’s
 from the Local Body table and the relationship
 is many-to-one, and doseId is PK


2- PatientsPersonalInfo table, PID is the primary key
 and this table holds the personal information of the patient which
 includes Name, Address, contactNumber, Age, medicalcondition or if he has any Allergy.
PatientInfo is connected with Patient with 1-to-many as patient treatment will be different
for everyone and Patient is connected with 1-to-many relationship with doses to get the
record of every patient w.r.t their dose type.



3- Dose Table, PId  is the Foreign key and which get information of partient from 
personalinfo table the relationship is many-to-one. DoseID which is FK and get information
 from patient table the relationship is many-to-one.
ManuID which is FK represents the manufacturer of the Doses the relationship is many-to-one. table includes
Shot time indicates time when the shot was taken by the patient.
Manufacturer and PersonalInfo is connected with Doses as the patient will recieve the 
same dose as provided by Manufacturer and will be taken by patient and their info is in
PersonalInfo




4- Manufacturer table ManuID is the
 primary key and other information like ManufacturerName, 
Unit Type , Vaccine Name  which indicates the vaccine manufactured by
 the manufacturer and the vaccination type indicates vaccination for
 which medical condition.Manufacturer is connected with UnitDistribution with 1-to-many as its the only thing that 
will distribute the vaccines.



5- UnitDistrution table . DistID is PK ,LocalBodyID and the manuId is the
 foreign keys to Localbody table and Manufacturer table 
 and all the relationship between
 the Unit distribution table to the corresponding
 tables of the foreign key is many-to-one.
Also table has Qtyofdoses(quantity of dose), DistDate which represent day of distribution.
UnitDistrution table has relationship with DistByfederalGorv as one-to-many





6- localBody Table, LocalBodyID is the primary
 key and it includes localBodyName and the type of the localbody.
LocalBody is connected with DistByState, UnitDistribution and Patient with one to many
relationship as it collects Vaccines from different sources and gives to Patient.

 



7- DistByState table,localbodyID is the foreign key to localBody table and the relationship is many-to-one as it
 includes how many number of localbodies are included in a particular
 state and how many quantity of doses obtained in a particular state.
stateName is foreign key to DistByFederalGorv table and relationship between them is many-to-one as 
how many of distributions state get by Governments.



8- DistByFedralGov table, stateName as the primary key 
and the DistId as foreign key to Unitdistribution table and relationship is Many-to-one as
many states can have one unit. QtyBydistance how many quantity of doses are being transferred
to a particular state. DistByFederalGorv is connected with DistByState with 1-to-many relationship as
 Federal Government will distribute vaccine to all the states.
